      <h1>History of HTTP 1.0 vs 1.1🔗</h1>
      <p class="item">
        HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the backbone of the internet,
        responsible for transmitting data between web browsers and servers. The
        first version, HTTP 1.0, was introduced in 1996 and has since been
        updated to HTTP 1.1, which was first defined in 1999.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="item">
        One of the main differences between the two versions is the way they
        handle connections. HTTP 1.0 uses a separate connection for each
        request, while HTTP 1.1 can reuse a single connection for multiple
        requests. This results in faster transfer speeds, as the overhead of
        creating a new connection is eliminated.
      </p>

      ><br />
      <p class="item">
        HTTP 1.1 also introduced new methods such as PUT and DELETE, in addition
        to the existing GET and POST methods. This allows for more flexibility
        in interacting with web resources.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="item">
        Another important feature of HTTP 1.1 is support for the "Host" header,
        which allows a single IP address to host multiple websites. In HTTP 1.0,
        the IP address of the server must match the domain name of the website.
        <br />
        In addition, HTTP 1.1 includes the "chunked transfer encoding" which
        allows the server to send data in chunks to the client in real-time,
        rather than waiting until the entire response is ready. This feature is
        useful for long-polling, server-sent events and streaming. In
        conclusion, while HTTP 1.0 is still in use, HTTP 1.1 is the preferred
        version of the protocol, as it offers improved performance, caching
        capabilities, and flexibility. Most modern web browsers and servers
        support HTTP 1.1, making it the de facto standard for web communication.
